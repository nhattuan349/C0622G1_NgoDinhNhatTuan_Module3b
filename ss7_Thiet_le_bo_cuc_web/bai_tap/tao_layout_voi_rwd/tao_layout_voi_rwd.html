            <h4>Welcome to Vietnam</h4>
            <p>Stretching over 2500 km along the coast, weather in Vietnam varies from the North to the South.
                Travelling between November and February is the great time to visit all the places along the country as
                it is winter in Vietnam. During this time, the weather in the North is colder than the rest of the year,
                with the temperature similar to autumn in the Western countries while dry season with warm sunshine
                starts in the South. In addition, there are many special festivals and celebrations during this time
                such as Christmas, Lunar New Year and others interesting folk activities which add more color and
                excitement to the cities. However, the festival time also means that the price of transportation
                tickets, hotels, and others services at this time often go up dramatically.

                Southern Vietnam, in the opposite side, does not have winter. This part of the country enjoys a warm
                climate all year around, with temperature ranging from 22 to 34 Celsius Degrees. From March to June, you
                had better choose to visit Vietnam beaches in the Centre and South Vietnam to enjoy the clear sky,
                shining sunshine and gentle sea wave. Storm season in the Centre and rainy season in Mekong Delta starts
                in July and last until October. Be prepared for heavy rain and flood if you are planning to travel
                during this time.</p>

            <h4>Prepare Vietnam visa prior to the trip</h4>
            <p>There is no visa on arrival to Vietnam. You need to apply from Vietnamese Embassy in your country or
                contact with authorized online agent to get “letter of approval” before taking the flight to Vietnam.
                With the first option, you need to go to the nearest Embassy or Consulate or send your passport by post
                to them. The process may take a month and if approved, visa will be stamped on your passport. The
                advantage of this option is that you do not have to queue at their VOA counter when arriving airports.
                The disadvantages for me are the inconvenience of travelling to the Vietnamese Embassy which located in
                capital and the fear of losing my passport when it is sent by post.

                The second option is to use service of a travel agent in Vietnam, fill some forms and get the approval
                letter in one or two days. With this letter, you need to queue and present it to VOA counter and they
                will stamp Vietnam visa on your passport. I find this option is safer and easier for me as every step I
                can do online, no worrisome of losing my passport and shorter time to get my visa. I use
                vietnamvisa.org.vn and get what I want. The only annoying thing is the long queue at the custom window.
                My advice is that depend on your situation; choose the option that better suit you.</p>
